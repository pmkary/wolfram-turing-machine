# The most simple Turing Machine

The [Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram%27s_2-state_3-symbol_Turing_machine) is the world's most simple turing machine using a very very simple rewriting machine. This is a very simple implementation of that algorithm in the most basic terms just to have fun with it. This is all you have to run it:

```
% go run turing/main.go
```
